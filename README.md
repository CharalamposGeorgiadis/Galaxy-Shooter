Space Shooter game that began as a very basic game tutorial from a webinar on Game Development with Unity.

Apart from most of the gameplay that was programmed following the tutorial I also added the following functionalities:
1. Online Leaderboards using LootLocker.
2. Main and Pause menus and submenus containing:
   - Audio volume sliders, the settings of which are stored in the Player's Preferences so that the game remembers them every time they run it. A random audio sample of the appropriate audio type is played every time the Player moves that audio type's slider.
   - Control Rebinding, where the key bindings are stored in the Player's Preferences as well.
   - Ability to view Leaderboards loaded from LootLocker's website.
3. Sign In and Sign Up menus so that each Player's score can be saved on LootLocker's website.
4. Asteroid spawning and chance to spawn smaller asteroids when one is destroyed by a laser.
5. Background music, with track shuffling, that is continuously active on every scene.
6. In-Game Background Randomization.
7. Multiple Button and InputField animations.
8. Loading Screen.
